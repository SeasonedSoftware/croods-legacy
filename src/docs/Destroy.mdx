## How to use

Don't forget to add a reducer with the same name used here in your rootReducer, with **createReducer**

```javascript
import { Destroy } from 'croods'

export default (
  <Destroy
    name="pets"
    id="123"
    // if path is different than /pets/${id}, you can set a custom path like so:
    // path='/customPath'
    render={destroy => <DestroyButton destroy={destroy} />}
  />
)
```

### render

The render function is used to render a component passing to it a **destroy** function, and
pass it to any component you like.

## Example

You can see a working example using this component in [here](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware/croods/blob/master/example/src/colors/Destroy.js).
