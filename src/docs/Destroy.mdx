# Destroy

The Destroy component provides an easy way to destroy a resource in the server, using the response as needed.

## API

| -------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name     | String        | true     | -                | It must be equal to the reducer name set in your `rootReducer.js` and will be used as `path` if none is provided Ex: `baseUrl/name`. |
| id       | String/Number | true     | -                | It defines the ID of the resource to be destroyed, passing it in the url as defined in path.                                         |
| render   | Func          | true     | -                | A function returning a React Node. Ex: ({ list }, props) -> < JSX />                                                                 |
| parentId | String/Number | false    | -                | Parent element's ID, for nested resources.                                                                                           |
| path     | String        | false    | `/${name}/${id}` | Ex: /foo/123                                                                                                                         |

## How to use

Don't forget to add a reducer with the same name used here in your rootReducer, with **createReducer**

```javascript
import { Destroy } from 'croods'

export default (
  <Destroy
    name="pets"
    id="123"
    // if path is different than /pets/${id}, you can set a custom path like so:
    // path='/customPath'
    render={destroy => <DestroyButton destroy={destroy} />}
  />
)
```

### render

The render function is used to render a component passing to it a **destroy** function, and
pass it to any component you like.

## Example

You can see a working example using this component in [here](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware/croods/blob/master/example/src/colors/Destroy.js).
