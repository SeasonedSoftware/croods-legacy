# New

The List component provides a way to fetch a list from an api, using the response as needed, fetching or set a resource and show or use the response data.

## API

| Property | Type          | Required | Default    | Description                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | String        | true     | -          | It must be equal to the reducer name. Defines the deep properties used in the component. Ex: foo.bar |
| render   | Func          | true     | -          | A function returning a React Node. Ex: ({ create, creating = bool, error }, props) -> < JSX />       |
| parentId | String/Number | false    | -          | Parent element's Id, for more specificity in changes.                                                |
| path     | String        | false    | `/${name}` | Ex: /foo/bar-\_12?&=                                                                                 |

## How to use

You have to add a reducer with the same name that you will pass to List.

```javascript
import { createReducer } from 'croods'

const reducers = {
  foobar: createReducer('foobar'),
}
```

### render

The render function receives three important parameters, **create** (func), **creating** (bool) and **error** (string).

- The **list** is an array with the response.
- The \*\*listError is a bool to identify if the request is being done.
- The **error** is populated after the use of create if the server response has an error status code.

### renderCreated

The renderCreated function is fired when the create function is used and the server response has a 2xx status.
It receives the `created` parameter that contains the server response body.

## Example
