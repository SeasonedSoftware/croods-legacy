# New

The New component provides a way to render elements, to create a resource and show or use the response data.

## How to use

You have to add a reducer with the same name that you will pass to New.

```javascript
import { createReducer } from 'croods'

const reducers = {
  foobar: createReducer('foobar'),
}
```

### render

The render function receives three important parameters, **create** (func), **creating** (bool) and **error** (string).

- The **create** function makes a `POST` request on `path` with the jsonified object parameter as body.
- The **creating** is a bool to identify if the request is being done.
- The **error** is populated after the use of create if the server response has an error status code.

### renderCreated

The renderCreated function is fired when the create function is used and the server response has a 2xx status.
It receives the `created` parameter that contains the server response body.

## Example
