# New

The New component provides a way to create a resource and show or use the response data.


## API

| name          | String             | true     | -          | It must be equal to the reducer name. Defines the deep properties used in the component. Ex: foo.bar |
| render        | Func               | true     | -          | A function returning a React Node. Ex: ({ create, creating = bool, error }, props) -> < JSX />       |
| renderCreated | Func               | false    | -          | A function returning a React Node. Ex: (created = {}) -> < JSX />                                    |
| parentId      | String/Number      | false    | -          | Parent element's Id, for more specificity in changes.                                                |

| method        | Enum (post or put) | false    | `post`     | The http request method.                                                                             |

## How to use

You have to add a reducer with the same name that you will pass as prop to the New component.

```javascript
import { createReducer } from 'croods'

const reducers = {
  foobar: createReducer('foobar'),
}
```

### render

The render function receives three important parameters, **create** (func), **creating** (bool) and **error** (string).

- The **create** function makes a `POST` request on `path` with the JSONified object parameter as body.
- The **creating** is a boolean that will be `true` while requesting and will switch back to `false` once the request succeeds or fails.
- The `error` is populated after calling `create`, only if the server response has an error status code.

### renderCreated

The renderCreated function is fired when the `create` function is called and the server response is of 2xx status.
It receives one parameter: `created` containing the server's response body.
