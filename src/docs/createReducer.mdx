# createReducer

This function handles the creation of all the necessary reducers for croods to work.

## API

| Property | Type   | Required | Default                   | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| name     | String | true     | -                         | the name used to define this set of reducers.    |
| options  | Object | false    | { addCreatedToTop: false} | Aditional options. For now, only addCreatedToTop |

## How to use

You create a store as you usually would, using thunk as a middleware (needed by croods).
When you create your rootReducer, you add the reducers created by croods with **createReducer**, and that's it.

```javascript
// src/store.js

import { createReducer } from 'croods'

import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({ fooName: createReducer('fooName') })
// Alternatively, pass addCreatedToTop as an option:
// createReducer("fooName", { addCreatedToTop: true}) })

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))
```

You can pass **addCreatedToTop** option to add created objects to the top of the state's list.

## Example

You can see a working example using this function [here](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware/croods/blob/master/example/src/store/rootReducer.js).
